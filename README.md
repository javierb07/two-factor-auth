# Two Factor Authentication

I developed this system when I took IE5900 Electromechanical Robotic Systems at Purdue.

It's a project to establish two-factor authentication using a password and a camera to gain access to a system.

It was developed using an Arduino board, three push-buttons, a buzzer, and an LCD display.
